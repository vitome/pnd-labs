The adversary wants to attract the traffic of pc1 towards
pc2 (MITM). Then, it uses the ICMP redirect to perform it.

You have to use a1 to change the routing decision of pc1 when
moving to pc2 and use the lanX to see the traffic. You have to
use the redir6 tool.
a1 and r2 addressing and routing are also alread configured.

All the needed dependencies are installed, you only have to
compile the thc-toolkit (make redir6).

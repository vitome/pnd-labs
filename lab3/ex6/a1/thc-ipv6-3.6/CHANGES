	- fixed TTL setting when using raw mode
	- supporting mobile home address option in dst option (for checksum)
	- pcap was opened in promisc mode - shouldnt have been, unnecessary
	- valid icmp checksum for mobile home address and routing pointer == 0
 	- TCP can be now added as a header too + checksum calculation, but
	   not for inverse_packet (yet - no application for that currently).

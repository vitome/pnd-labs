INSTALLATION
============

THC-IPV6 requires libpcap development files being installed, also the
libopenssl development files are a good idea.

For Debian/Ubunut/Kali/Backtrack, you can install them by:
 $ sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev libssl-dev

For a few optional, obscure tools you need a libnetfilter library:
 $ sudo apt-get install libnetfilter-queue-dev

To compile simply type
 $ make

All tools are installed to /usr/local/bin if you type
 $ sudo make install

You need to be root to run most tools
